# Switch
Switch is also a JavaScript Conditional and logic syntax.
# Sopic 
Switch, switch is javascript language which also used for conditional and logic syntax. 
Howerver I've used I really love switch.

# Purpose
1. multi conditional syntax.
2. easy and clear code.
3. less effort. 

# Comparition with if else
Yes this also works as like if else forms but there is a different and easy coding syntax. 
As i've used this is really easy for multipurpose conditional syntax.
